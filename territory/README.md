# What these scripts are

These are basic starter probes for industrial protocols.

They exist to:

- Check whether a device is there
- Confirm which protocol it speaks
- Pull minimal, harmless identification data

Nothing clever. Nothing exhaustive.

## Why they look a bit awkward

ICS libraries are:

- Old
- Opinionated
- Written by people who assume you read the spec

So the code is explicit and slightly grumpy. That is normal.

# UU Power & Light - OT/ICS penetration testing

Penetration testing methodology, files, and scripts for assessing the security of 
[Unseen University's Power & Light Co](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/power/) industrial 
control systems. This repository contains the operational toolkit resulting from the comprehensive security assessment 
of their wind turbine farm.

*Making consequences feel real without making it actually real, which is considerably harder than it sounds but infinitely preferable to the alternative.*
